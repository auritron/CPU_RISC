# CPU_RISC
RISC based CPU on C/Python for school.

Arithmetic Instructions These perform basic arithmetic operations: ADD - Add two registers. SUB - Subtract two registers. MUL - Multiply two registers. DIV - Divide two registers.

Logical Instructions These perform bitwise logical operations: AND - Bitwise AND. OR - Bitwise OR. XOR - Bitwise XOR. NOT - Bitwise NOT.

Data Transfer Instructions These move data between registers and memory: LOAD - Load data from memory into a register. STORE - Store data from a register into memory. MOV - Move data between registers.

Control Flow Instructions These manage the flow of execution: JMP - Jump to a specific instruction. BEQ - Branch if equal (conditional jump based on comparison). BNE - Branch if not equal. CALL - Call a subroutine. RET - Return from a subroutine.

Shift/Rotate Instructions These perform bit shifts and rotations: SHL - Shift left. SHR - Shift right. ROL - Rotate left. ROR - Rotate right.

Comparison Instructions These compare values and set flags (used for conditional jumps): CMP - Compare two registers.
